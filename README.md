# MovieViewR

This is the first project in Udacity's Android Developer Nanaodegree program.

[![Udacity - Android Developer NanoDegree]()](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801)

In order for this project to be successful I need to meet the following requirements
* Movies are displayed in a grid of their posters
* UI contains a screen for displaying the details of a selected movie
* Movie details layout contains
  * title
  * release date
  * movie poster
  * vote average
  * plot synopsis
  * movie poster
* When a movie poster is selected the movie details view is launched
* In the background the app queries popular and highest voted movies
* App conforms to the Android Nanodegree General Project Guidelines

## To run

   An API key is required for this application to run.  The API key needs to be placed in
   the file located at: 
   app/src/main/java/../utilities/NetworkUtil at line 25.  
   There is a string variable called APIKey.  That is (perhaps obviously) 
   the spot to place your api inside the commas.
   
   ````
   private static final String APIKey = "";
   ````
